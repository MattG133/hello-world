# hello-world
I'm a Big Data student at Kozminski University, Finance graduate from University Of Warsaw. Programming and Big Data enthusiast, zealous stockmarket individual investor. I'm a high-energy, ambitious person that strives for a data science career.
Over the past years I've gained a considerable amount of experience, through studies and various clubs and courses I participate in. Sector or company analyses, historical price data analysis, financial modelling, scripting simple algorithms and apps in Python, Data Visualization or SQL queries are among the things I feel very comfortable with. Being a memeber of various student organizations where I took part in organizing such events as Warsaw Economic Forum or Akademia Private Equity has enabled me to gain a lot of teamwork experience.
I always put all my mind to projects I undertake.
